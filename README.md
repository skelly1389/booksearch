# Book Search

## Description

In the lead up to the final project for the bootcamp being able to put together the basic components of a mern app and the associated debugging should be a good asset.

## Installation

Live site at [https://book-search-h.herokuapp.com/](https://book-search-h.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage
From the home page use the search bar to find books using the google books api. Buttons view the book in the google store or save the book to a database. Looking at the saved books page shows all books saved to the database and gives the user the option to removed them from the collection.

## Credits

Used bootstrap for styling, lots of references to their docs and some friendly people's answers on stackoverflow. Class activities helped with a lot of the boiler-plate.
